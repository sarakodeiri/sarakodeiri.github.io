Hi :) I've currently finished my fourth year at [Iran University of Science and Technology](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en), getting my BSc. in Computer Engineering. I'm expected to graduate in January 2022. During this time, I've had the privilege to explore different topics in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering to broaden my knowledge. My research interests include Integration of Vision and Language, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Ethics in AI. You can view a summary of my CV in this post.
